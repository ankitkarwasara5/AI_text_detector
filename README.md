# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text 🤖

This project is a web application built with Flask and PyTorch to detect whether a given piece of text was written by a human or generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). It uses a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification.

## ✨ Features

* **High Accuracy:** Fine-tunes a pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model.
* **Interactive Web UI:** A simple web interface built with Flask to analyze text easily.
* **Confidence Score:** Provides a prediction (Human/AI) along with the model's confidence.
* **Robust Training:** The training script is optimized to handle large datasets for effective learning.

## 🔧 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Git

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME].git
cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
````

### 3\. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Download the Dataset

This model is trained on the **DAIGT V2 Train Dataset**.

  * Download the dataset from [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset).
  * Unzip the archive and place the `train_v2.csv` file in the root directory of this project.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1\. Train the Model

First, you need to train the model on the dataset. This will generate the `best_model_state_v2.bin` file which contains the trained weights.

```bash
python train.py
```

**Note:** Training will take a significant amount of time, especially without a GPU.

### 2\. Run the Web Application

Once the model is trained, you can start the Flask web server.

```bash
python app.py
```

### 3\. Use the Detector

Open your web browser and navigate to:
**https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:8080**

You can now paste any text into the text area and click "Analyze Text" to get a prediction.
