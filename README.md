# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text ü§ñ

This project is a web application built with **Flask** and **PyTorch** to detect whether a given piece of text was written by a human or generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). It uses a **fine-tuned BERT model** for text classification.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **High Accuracy**: Fine-tunes a pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model.
- **Interactive Web UI**: A simple web interface built with Flask to analyze text easily.
- **Confidence Score**: Provides a prediction (Human/AI) along with the model's confidence.
- **Robust Training**: The training script is optimized to handle large datasets for effective learning.

## üîß Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME].git
cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Download the Dataset

This model is trained on the **DAIGT V2 Train Dataset**.

- Download the dataset from [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).
- Unzip the archive and place the `train_v2.csv` file in the **root directory** of this project.

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Train the Model

First, you need to train the model on the dataset. This will generate the `best_model_state_v2.bin` file containing the trained weights.

```bash
python train.py
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Training will take a significant amount of time, especially without a GPU.

### 2. Run the Web Application

Once the model is trained, you can start the Flask web server.

```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Use the Detector

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

You can now paste any text into the text area and click **"Analyze Text"** to get a prediction.
